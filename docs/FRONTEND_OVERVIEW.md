# Frontend Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Dawaback frontend application, its architectural principles, and the overall data flow.

## 1. Introduction

The Dawaback frontend is a modern, responsive web application built to serve as the primary interface for users to interact with the Dawaback platform. It enables pharmacists to manage their deals, add pharmacies, connect with other professionals, and access various features designed to streamline operations within the medical community.

## 2. Architectural Principles

Our frontend architecture is guided by the following core principles to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable application:

- **Modularity**: The application is broken down into small, independent, and reusable modules (components, hooks, stores, services). This promotes reusability and simplifies understanding.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of the application (e.g., UI rendering, business logic, data fetching, state management) are distinctly separated into different layers or files. This makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and debug.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Leveraging React.js, the UI is composed of isolated, reusable components, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface.
- **Predictable State Management**: Using Zustand, we aim for a clear and predictable way to manage application-wide data, making debugging and understanding data flow straightforward.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on efficient rendering, lazy loading, and optimized network requests to provide a fast and smooth user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized and consistent error handling mechanisms are implemented to provide meaningful feedback to users and facilitate debugging.

## 3. High-Level Data Flow

The data flow in the Dawaback frontend generally follows a unidirectional pattern:

1.  **User Interaction**: A user interacts with a UI component (e.g., clicks a button, submits a form).
2.  **Event Handling**: The UI component's event handler triggers an action.
3.  **State Update / API Call**: The action might:
    - Directly update local component state.
    - Dispatch an action to a Zustand store to update global state.
    - Initiate an asynchronous operation, typically an API call to the backend.
4.  **API Communication**: An API service function (from `src/api/`) sends a request to the backend. `axios` handles the HTTP communication.
5.  **Backend Processing**: The backend processes the request, interacts with the database, and sends a response.
6.  **Response Handling**: The frontend receives the API response. Based on the response:
    - Global state might be updated via a Zustand store action.
    - Local component state might be updated.
    - Error messages or success notifications (toasts) are displayed.
7.  **UI Re-render**: React re-renders components whose state or props have changed, reflecting the latest data or UI updates to the user.

## 4. Key Technologies

- **React.js**: Core UI library.
- **Vite**: Build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework.
- **Zustand**: State management library.
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests.
- **Formik & Yup**: Form handling and validation.
- **Sonner**: Toast notifications.
